+ Eyes*
  Science:
  - Optical apparatus and movement of different species, e.g.
      Flies, Spiders, Wasps, Bees, Bats (sonic perception?),
      fish (deep sea?), birds, simple cellular organisms
  - Mapping of the perceived spectra of the different species to the human
    perceivable spectrum (papers on this topic)

  Gamification:
  - Search targets with different eyes. Different species have different
    "standard" activities.
    Implement one/two/... which can be solved with any vision system.
    I.e. All n vision systems can be chosen in all m species specific activities,
    or to put it differently: Equip character with another vision system.
    E.g. Ant foraging: search food and return to base as fast as possible.
  - Possibility to create your own vision system by configuring n eyes(cameras)
    and attach them to the model (ant, spider, whatever) and choose a layout
    for the 2D-screen / oculus.
    This lets the user test and develop better, task specific visual systems.
    Of course: save/load
  - Species-task specific companions/enemies which need to be simulated

  Complexity:
  - In combination with the oculus rift: visual complexity in
    processing/perceiving the environment.
  - learning about the visual systems of other species
  - Dunno about model complexity, yet.

  Aesthetics:

  Eyes are tailored to a specific environment. How do eyes work in environments
  they are not designed for? E.g. "How would a spider perceive the deep sea?".
  All eye-implementations are available in all environments.
