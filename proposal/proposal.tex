\section{Introduction/Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Give people the opportunity to experience other perception systems
  than the human eye ⇒ understanding why moths are caught by light, why
  flies fly in your eye while bicycling, why flies fly against glass...

\end{itemize}

\section{Concept}
\begin{itemize}
\item At least 2 other visual systems to choose from
\item One or more tasks to solve using those available systems.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Find a flower or some sweets (Bee/Wasp)
    \item Find something and return to the colony as fast as possible (Ant)
    \item Go as far as possible in the night without dying (moth)
    \item Find an exit to the room/café/drinking glass (caught by some human)/...
    \item Cross the highway
  \end{itemize}
\item Model the visual systems as realistically as possible.
\item Use oculus rift / Google Cardboard to address each eye individually
→ different modes:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Both human eyes see the same images to have a flat, monitor like view
  \item For binocular systems: One-to-one mapping of the eyes
        For multiocular systems: Map them somehow to the two human eyes
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Experience}

\section{Project Requirements}
The pinhole camera model used in most computer graphics software to mimic
the human visual perception is a rather crude approximation to the real world.
We do not recognize this most of the time, because we are used to it or to
put it differently, because our brain does a lot of preprocessing.
One example is the \emph{blind spot} where the optic nerve exits the eye.
In this area there are no photoreceptor cells and thus no visual information is
available. Yet, we don't notice this in everyday life since the brain merges
the information of the left and the right eye and compensates this lack of
information. The same goes for optical distortion

Although we do not see
\begin{description}
\item[Science]
- Optical apparatus and movement of different species, e.g.
    Flies, Spiders, Wasps, Bees, Bats (sonic perception?),
    fish (deep sea?), birds, simple cellular organisms
- Mapping of the perceived spectra of the different species to the human
  perceivable spectrum (papers on this topic)
- How is polarized light perceived?
- Mapping of the layout of one system to the human visual system
See \cite{insectvision}

Different eye types
\begin{itemize}
  \item Simple eyes
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Pit
    \item Spherical lensed
    \item Multiple lenses
    \item Refractive cornea
    \item Reflector
  \end{itemize}
  \item Compound eyes
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Apposition
    \item Superposition
    \item Parabolic superposition
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item[Gamification]
- Search targets with different eyes. Different species have different
  \"standard\" activities.
  Implement one/two/... which can be solved with any vision system.
  I.e. All n vision systems can be chosen in all m species specific activities,
  or to put it differently: Equip character with another vision system.
  E.g. Ant foraging: search food and return to base as fast as possible.
- Possibility to create your own vision system by configuring n eyes(cameras)
  and attach them to the model (ant, spider, whatever) and choose a layout
  for the 2D-screen / oculus.
  This lets the user test and develop better, task specific visual systems.
  Of course: save/load
- Species-task specific companions/enemies which need to be simulated

\item[Complexity]
- In combination with the oculus rift: visual complexity in
  processing/perceiving the environment.
- learning about the visual systems of other species
- Dunno about model complexity, yet.
