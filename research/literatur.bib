        abstract = {Visually impaired people have a very different view of the world such that seemingly simple environments as viewed by a {\textquoteleft}normally{\textquoteright} sighted people can be difficult for people with visual impairments to access and move around. This is a problem that can be hard to fully comprehend by people with {\textquoteleft}normal vision{\textquoteright} even when guidelines for inclusive design are available. This paper investigates ways in which image processing  techniques can be used to simulate the characteristics of a number of common visual impairments in order to provide, planners, designers and architects, with a visual representation of how people with visual impairments view their environment, thereby promoting greater understanding of the issues, the creation of more accessible buildings and public spaces and increased accessibility for visually impaired people in everyday situations.}
