\section{Introduction}
Eye diseases have been an issue throughout all the human history.
In the beginning the focus layed on their treatment.
However, Virtual Reality (VR) is more and more pushing into the consumer market and could therefor be broadly used for education and thus prevention of eye diseases.
For example, the risk of suffering from retinal detachment can be greatly reduced if the signs are recognized early and a doctor is consulted.
Therefore, educational software can be used.
In addition, people would hopefully visit a doctor earlier if they already experienced a good simulation of a severe state of a disease, before they actually are in a severe state.
Other applications could be testing designs of consumer products like packaging or traffic signs or other signs at public places.

Although there are many simulations available already, they usually work on still 2D images, 2D video streams or static 3D scenes and don't have any game component.
Moreover, more sophisticated simulations are probably not easily available for public use and implementing a simulator using Unity3D in terms of an \emph{eye disease asset set} wrapped into a small game could be interesting for a broad audience.

So we implemented three visual disease simulators in Unity3D and applied them in a small game.
In this game the player has to collect items in a Supermarket, which is likely to be a well-known situation to everyone.

\section{Related Work}
There are different eye disease simulators available in the web already.
However, common ones, e.g. found on websites of health organizations, alter still 2D images and display them in the browser.
For example, the "Sehbehinderungs-Simulator" of ABSV~\cite{absv} lets the user choose from five different diseases and four different images to apply them to. 
There are also real-time simulations available as descriped by~\cite{eyediseasesim-zhuming} but the implementation is not available online.

\section{Models and Methods}
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item Fulfill everyday tasks with impaired vision
%  \item Possible boni: 
%  \begin{itemize}
%    \item Get rid of disease by performing the right actions
%    e.g. take medication on the way or make a doctors appointment...
%    \item Preventive measures during the task to not get disease in next lvl
%  \end{itemize}
%  \item Target platform: Android \& Google Cardboard to address many people
%\end{itemize}

Assets: Inventory Master - uGUI (Sander Buchheim), Supermarket Interior (FireMesh), Drag and Drop Pause Menu (Cinopt Studios)

The player is able to experience different types of eye diseases varying in severity.
%This is supposed to give people better judgment on when to visit a doctor as well as the courage to do so, if they experience the symptoms of a particular disease.
%
%There will be at least the first 6 different eye diseases in \Fref{tab:eye_diseases} either to choose from in every task or appear at least once in the game.
%
%Possible tasks could be based on reading (visual acuity), distinguishing objects (color), and navigating in everyday environments (limited field of view).
%This may be realized required for cooking, working at a line in a factory sorting screws or similar things, using public transport or driving a car (at night), food shopping, going to the pharmacy getting the right medication, find hidden object given written hints, or board/care games.
The game is set in a supermarket where the player has to shop for different objects.
There are five different eye diseases to experience in five different levels.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{menu.png}
    \caption{Menu.}
    \label{fig:menu}
\end{figure}

When the game starts the player is able to see a menu shown in figure 1, in this he can choose between 5 different levels or exit the game. Each of levels got different eye dissease witch makes it more difficult to finish the level. In all of the Level's the player is asked to collect different Items to finish his shopping list. The Player starts near the entrance of the shop as seen in figure 2. Then he can walk with W,A,S,D through the shop and pick up different items like Milk or Bacon with pressing the E button. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Game.png}
    \caption{Overwiev over the view of the Player}
    \label{fig:gamestart}
\end{figure}

If the player press I a shopping bag appears where he can see what items he already picked up. Each items got a small discription with some informations about it seen in figure 3. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{ShoppingBag.png}
    \caption{Shopping Bag}
    \label{fig:ShoppingBag}
\end{figure}

The game finish if the times runs out or the players goes to the till. After this he gets points for each correct item he picked up and a bonus for the left over time.



%Ideally the chosen tasks would be individual levels which depend on each other and will tell a small story, like car driving → food shopping → cooking.
%The user can either choose the disease for the level himself or a random disease is selected in the beginning.
%The chosen disease should become worse over the time (within one level or across levels) but, if possible and accurate (neglecting the time), the user should also be able to slow down the process or even heal the disease completely.
%Therefore he/she has to take the appropriate measures for the specific disease.
%In order to convincingly convey the topic, using a VR device like the Oculus Rift or an mobile phone / Google Cardboard combination would be beneficial to the project.


As described in \cite{gazedisplays} and \cite{eyediseasesim} effects like
blurry or distorted vision, floaters, and reduced field of view can be
efficiently implemented by using fragment shaders. The individual properties
of the shaders and how to decompose the individual diseases into different
shaders (re-usability) is subject to the first research block. But since this
appears to be a very well researched topic, we're confident that we won't run
into any major difficulties.

\section{The human eye}
Since eye diseases are supposed to be simulated in a virtual environment this section begins with a brief overview over the human eye in comparison to man-made cameras and their abstraction of the pinhole camera used in modern computer graphics.

As can be seen in \Fref{fig:humaneye} the human eye is a spherical shaped organ letting light enter through the pupil to form an image of the world at the retina.
This hole consists of the cornea, the pupli and the lense which act as an objective enabling the eye to focus on various distances and adapt to bright and dark scenes.
The cornea is a transparent layer with a rather fixed shape and therefore a fixed refractive index.
It focuses the light on the pupil which prevents too much light from entering the eye like an aperture.
The lense finally focuses the light on the retina by altering its shape which effectivly changes its focal length.
So unlike in cameras focusing is not achieved by altering the distance of the lenses to the sensor but by altering the focal length.
The retina is photosensitive tissue at the back of the eye consisting of rods and cones.
Cones are responsible for color vision and operate in daylight light conditions whereas rods are more light sensitive and provide gray-scale night vision.
But unlike camera sensors, where red, green, and blue pixels are evenly distributed, the retina has a inhomogene layout.
There is the Macula, which is an area with a very high rod and cone density.
The central part of the Macula is called the Fovea which consists solely of tightly packed cones.
Compared to the Macula, the rest of the eye, however, has a fairly low resolution and mostly consists of the non-color sensitive rods.

\subsection{Color blindness}
A first step in simulation color blindness is to understand what color actually is and how humans perceive it.
At first color is nothing than an illusion created in our brain.
From a physical point of view, light can be thought of its spectral intensities.
Each cone type of the human eye has a responsitivity curve that defines how sensitive that cone type is to a specific wave length.
Those responsitivity curves were first determined by a color matching experiment in 1931

    \item[Curvature myopia]
    Execssive or increased curvature of one or more of the refractive surfaces of the eye. Mostly the cornea.

\item[Nocturnal myopia]
\end{description}

For a reference on real-time focal blur/depth of field see \cite{gpugems-DoF, gpugems3-DoF}.

Change in focal length yields zoom. Big focal length = big zoom, small focal length = wide angle\\
Moving the fixed focal-length lense away and towards the canvas focuses. \\
Given the cornea-retina distance of 24mm, the focal-length range of the human eye can be estimated by [20,69mm - 24mm] for a distance range from 15cm to ∞ (see research/FocalLengthDiopters.ods) using the formula
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{d_p} + \frac{1}{d_I} = \frac{1}{f}.
\end{equation}
In order to simulate Myopia/Hyopia we calculate the required focal length for the altered retinal distance based on
\begin{equation}
    f = \frac{d_p d_I}{d_p + d_I}
\end{equation}
and truncate the value to the

\section{Summary \& Future Work}
Vinnikov \etal \cite{gazedisplays} developed a Gaze-Contingent-Display in order to evaluate the users eye direction and adept the displayed images in real-time.
Because the effects of eye diseases follow the eye movement, i.e. are static with respect to the eye coordinate frame, they achieved more realistic results in comparison to rendering gaze-independent images.
A consumer solution is under development by the German company SensoMotoric Instruments (SIM) which provides an gaze tracking solution update for the Oculus Rift DK 2 \cite{smi-oculus, arstechoculus}.
According to their website they also provide an integration into various VR engines, including Unity3D, available making it especially interesting for this project.

The gaze-direction would be useful to accurately simulate the vision fields and would also be an interesting human interface for the game mechanics.
